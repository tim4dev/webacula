Webacula terminal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Webacula provides an ajax interface to Bacula Console (bconsole) - Webacula
terminal.

Important to understand that you need to write commands to 'bconsole' in 
the command-line-style. Webacula terminal is not fully interactive.

For example, you do not have to write in terminal:
    status

correctly write so:
    status all

or:
   status dir
   status storage="storage.file.1"

an so on.



See Bacula documentation "Running the Console from a Shell Script" chapter for
details.
