                               About this manual

   The basic features of Webacula see in README file.

   This manual should give you to install or upgrade Webacula installation.

   If you find errors or typos please [18]send a bug report.

   Thanks.

   Webacula has a number of email lists. For general information subscribing
   to or unsubscribing from these lists, please see [19]Webacula Mailing
   Lists.

                              System Requirements

   To check the installed system packages, run from command line:

 install/check_system_requirements.php

   NOTE. The successful execution of the script does not indicate that your
   system is fully ready to work with Webacula.

   Webacula also requires:
     * Bacula 7.0 or later
     * Zend Framework version from 1.10.0 to 1.12.3 [20]Please see the system
       requirements appendix for more detailed information.
     * PHP 5.3.2 or later with PDO extension active.
     * Apache and mod_rewrite. Or equivalent web-server, for example, nginx
       and ngx_http_rewrite_module
     * Installed php-gd package
     * Installed [21]http://php.net/dom for use the RSS feed
     * Browser compatibility: all jQuery UI plugins are tested for IE 6.0+,
       Firefox 3+, Safari 3.1+, Opera 9.6+, Google Chrome

                                    Install

Make directory tree

   Login as root and make directory /var/www/webacula (for example). Copy
   Webacula distribution to this directory.

   [22]Download minimal Zend Framework package and extract. Copy the contents
   from directory
   ZendFramework-*-minimal/library/Zend
   to
   webacula/library/Zend

   NOTE. If you use the Zend Framework for multiple sites, then you can place
   it in a folder that is part of your PHP include path. By doing this, you
   will have access to the Zend Framework components in all PHP scripts.

   The tree which should turn out as a result :

 /var/www/webacula/
 |-- application
 |   |-- controllers
 |   |-- models
 |   `-- views
 ...
 |-- data
 |   `-- cache
 ...
 |-- docs
 |-- install
 |-- html
 |-- languages
 `-- library
     |-- MyClass
     `-- Zend (here is Zend Framework package)
         |-- Acl
         |-- Auth
         |-- Cache
        ...

   PHP session is stored in the table webacula_php_session.

   Some directory description:

   application/ All source code. Should be available to reading for the
   Web-server and no access through the client Web-browser.

   html/ Public code. Should be available to reading for the Web-server and
   for the client Web-browser.

   data/ IMPORTANT. This directory, subdirectory and files in it must NOT be
   available to access through the client Web-browser.

   data/cache/ Cache directory for Zend_Cache. Should be available to writing
   the Web-server and no access through the client Web-browser.

config.ini

   Specify the parameters to connect to the Catalog database, timezone and
   other in application/config.ini

Setting up to run bconsole under Webacula

   Create system group account (if not yet created) :
   groupadd bacula

   Add apache to group:
   usermod -aG bacula apache

   IMPORTANT. Check /opt/bacula/sbin/bconsole it should be the binary ELF
   file, not a shell script!

   Next, setup bconsole can be executed under Apache webserver.

  Without using sudo

 chown root:bacula /opt/bacula/sbin/bconsole
 chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=  /opt/bacula/sbin/bconsole

 chown root:bacula /opt/bacula/etc/bconsole.conf
 chmod u=rw,g=r,o= /opt/bacula/etc/bconsole.conf

   Edit application/config.ini

 bacula.sudo = ""
 bacula.bconsole = "/opt/bacula/sbin/bconsole"

  With sudo

   Edit application/config.ini

 bacula.sudo = "/usr/bin/sudo"
 bacula.bconsole = "/opt/bacula/sbin/bconsole"

   Run visudo and changes

 # (!!! comment here !!!) Defaults requiretty
 apache ALL=NOPASSWD: /opt/bacula/sbin/bconsole

   Check out the run bconsole :

 # su -l apache -s /bin/sh \
      -c "/usr/bin/sudo /opt/bacula/sbin/bconsole -n -c /opt/bacula/etc/bconsole.conf"

Apache

   Configuration for Apache see in install/apache/webacula.conf file.

   NOTE. Specific directories on your system may be different.

   Next, restart your Webserver.

  mod_rewrite

   Setup mod_rewrite see html/.htaccess. Edit RewriteBase parameter if
   necessary.

   NOTE. Specific directories on your system may be different.

   Check mod_rewrite installed :

 $ apachectl -t -D DUMP_MODULES 2>&1 | grep rewrite

 rewrite_module (shared)

   For testing mod_rewrite change RewriteBase parameter, if necessary, in
   webacula/html/test_mod_rewrite/.htaccess file.

   And use URL like [23]http://localhost/webacula/test_mod_rewrite/ for test
   mod_rewrite.

PHP

   Increase values in /etc/php.ini :

 memory_limit = 32M
 max_execution_time = 3600

Bacula setup

   To show messages of the Job output, you must make changes in
   bacula-dir.conf file :

 Messages {
   Name = Standard
   ...
   catalog = all, !skipped, !saved
 }

   and restart Bacula Director.

   See also manual of Bacula "Chapter 15. Messages Resource".

Webacula install

   If necessary change settings in install/db.conf file.

   IMPORTANT. Change passwords in a file install/db.conf. Use
   password-to-hash.php <password> and insert the resulting hash as
   webacula_root_pwd.

   Next create Webacula tables, Webacula built-in roles and Webacula built-in
   users.

   For MySQL:

 cd install/MySql

   For PostgreSQL:

 cd install/PostgreSql

   For Sqlite:

 cd install/SqLite

   And further run scripts for your DBMS is running on localhost:

 ./10_make_tables.sh
 ./20_acl_make_tables.sh

   If your DBMS is running on a remote host, specify the appropriate option
   on the command line, for example, MySQL:

 ./10_make_tables.sh      --host my.domain.tld
 ./20_acl_make_tables.sh  --host my.domain.tld

   Change file html/.htaccess :

 SetEnv APPLICATION_ENV production
 RewriteBase   /webacula

   After that, you can login under the superuser root and the password which
   specified in a file install/db.conf in parameter webacula_root_pwd.

                                 Webacula setup

Webacula and Bacula ACLs

   Bacula ACLs -- Bacula Console Access Control List -- it is necessary to
   understand as it is described in the original documentation in section
   ''Bacula Main Reference'', ''Configuring the Director'', ''The Console
   Resource''.

   In Webacula are implemented following Bacula ACLs :
     * JobACL
     * ClientACL
     * StorageACL
     * PoolACL
     * FileSetACL
     * WhereACL

   Special keyword *all* when is present, any resource or command name will
   be accepted.

   Webacula ACLs -- it as a matter of fact access to certain menu items of
   Webacula.

                            Figure 1: Webacula ACLs
                                 [24]Image ACLs 

   If the user (more precisely -- a role) does not have any a ACL rule, that
   user has no rights.

   ACL rules are applied in the order which is defined by field value
   ''order''.

   Bacula and Webacula ACLs can conflict. For example, usage of a Bacula
   command status is allowed to the user, but access to Webacula menu item
   Director at the same time is forbidden.

   In this case the user sees the message like :

 You try to use Webacula menu "director".
 Webacula ACLs : Access denied.

   And on the contrary. Access to Webacula menu item Director can be allowed.
   And usage of a Bacula command status can be forbidden.

   In this case the user sees the message like :

 You try to run Bacula Console with command "status".
 Bacula ACLs : Access denied.

   NOTE. Pay attention that in the first case access has been forbidden by a
   Webacula ACL rule, and in the second a Bacula ACL rule.

Users and roles

   In Webacula the concept of users and roles is used. Each user has the
   role. There is no user without a role.

   In other words you should create a role at first, and then create the user
   and assign to it a certain role.

   The role can inherit from other role.

   After install, Webacula has two built in roles :

     * root_role -- default built-in superuser role.
     * operator_role -- typical built-in role for backup operator.

   Users who have the role root_role is assigned are superusers, they have
   all rights to all. This role cannot be deleted and the role name cannot be
   changed.

   After installation root_role is assigned to the user with a login name
   root.

   The role operator_role can fulfill any operations except of the
   administarators functions : creation, change, assignment of roles, users.

                           Upgrade from prior version
