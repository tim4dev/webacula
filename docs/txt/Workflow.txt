Webacula workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Feature releases are numbered (and tagged) as 'X.Y' and are meant to
  contain bugfixes and enhancements, including functionality,
  performance and usability, without unit tests.

- Maintenance releases is supported only for the current release. 
Maintenance releases does not support backports. 
Maintenance releases are numbered (and tagged) as 'X.Y.Z'

- All bugfixes since of the last feature release fall
  into the 'master' branch (possibly through a merge with topic 
  branch), accumulate and testing there and release as the form 
  of the next release candidate, which is tagged as 'X.Y.rcZ'
  Where 'X.Y' - is number of appropriate feature release, 
  'Z' - increase number of release candidate.

- Files which contain the release candidates can be downloaded from 
  the directory 'webacula/current' in Sourceforge.
  Or get with the command:

  git archive X.Y.rcZ --prefix='webacula/' | \
    gzip > webacula-`git describe X.Y.rcZ`.tar.gz

  From Sourceforge or Github:
  git://webacula.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/webacula/webacula
  git://github.com/tim4dev/webacula.git

- 'master' branch is used to prepare for the release candidates and
  for next feature release.

- Code, which is in the 'master' branch has been tested and is stable
  enough for use.

- Assistance will be accepted as described in the file 4CONTRIBUTORS.
  Commits retain authorship with the command:
  git commit --author="A U Thor <author@example.com>"

- In the 'master' branch there is an object with the tag
  'maintainer-gpg-public-key' to verify the signature tags.

- 'web' - it is a separate branch for developing the website.
